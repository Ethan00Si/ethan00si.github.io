## About Me

I am an undergraduate student at [School of Information](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/).
I joined the [Big Data Analytics and Intelligence Lab](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/academic_research_lab_detail.php?id=20) in 2020. 

## Research Interests

***Information Retrieval***
- **Search Engine:** learning to rank, learning to match
- **Recommender System:** joint search and recommendation model
